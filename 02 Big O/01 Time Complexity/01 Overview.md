### Overview

We use Big O, to measure/compare how good an algorithm is.

**Timer**

Oviously, we can put timer before the algorithm execution and after the execution and measure the time an algorithm takses to execute. But even with the same input and output, it may differ by couple of factores,

    - The power of CPU,
    - Other programs running on the same machine
    - The programming laguage is being used etc.

So time can not be an ideal way to measure an algorithms efficiency.

**Measurement Uisng Big-O**

Couple of metrics we use to calculate the Big(O),

- O(1) => Very Good
- O(log n) => Excellent
- O(n) => Good
- O(n log n) => Fair
- o(n^2) => Can we improve??
- O(n!) => Horrible
